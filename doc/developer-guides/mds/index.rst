Module Design Specification
###########################

ACRN hypervisor is decomposed into a series of components,
some of which are further decomposed into several modules.
The goal of ACRN module design is to further specify the
files implementing a module, the macros and declarations
in each file and the internals of each declaration.

This section contains the documentation automatically extracted
from the code.
